#
#  All the Sparspack routines have been converted to C with the F2C
# converter. We do not include in the distribution the original Fortran 77
# code in the interest of saving disk space.
#
#  All Sparsepack routines are prepended with SPARSEPACK to reduce
# name space pollution.
#
#  This code uses the original SPARSEPACK software that was released
# into the public domain. Thus it can be used for any purpose.
# IT IS NOT THE VERSION OF SPARSEPACK THAT REQUIRES A LICENSE
