Testing hand-coded gradient (hc) against finite difference gradient (fd), if the ratio ||fd - hc|| / ||hc|| is
0 (1.e-8), the hand-coded gradient is probably correct.
Run with -tao_test_display to show difference
between hand-coded and finite difference gradient.
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 6.99921e-06, difference ||fd-hc|| = 9.88653e-07
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 5.17622e-06, difference ||fd-hc|| = 1.81331e-06
ratio ||fd-hc||/||hc|| = 8.42428e-06, difference ||fd-hc|| = 2.95116e-06
