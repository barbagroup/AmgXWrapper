This directory contains the files for the GPCG paper.

The root file is gpcg.tex

The component files are

  cover.tex  - Cover page
  intro.tex  - Introduction
  qp.tex     - Description of the quadratic programming problem
  design.tex - Software design of TAO
  comp.tex   - Computational results

The files intro2.tex and comp2.tex contain previous versions of these
files. There is still good material in them!

I have also added several style files to the ../sty directly.
