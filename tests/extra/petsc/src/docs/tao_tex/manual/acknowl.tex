\section*{Acknowledgments}

We especially thank Jorge Mor\'e for his leadership, vision, and effort on 
previous versions of TAO.  

TAO relies on PETSc for the linear algebra required to solve optimization
problems, and we have benefited from the PETSc team's experience, tools, 
software, 
and advice. In many ways, TAO is a natural outcome of the PETSc 
development.  

TAO has benefited from the work of various researchers who have provided 
solvers, test problems, and interfaces.  In particular, we acknowledge Lisa 
Grignon, Elizabeth Dolan, Boyana Norris, Gabriel Lopez-Calva, Yurii Zinchenko, 
Michael Gertz, Jarek Nieplocha, Limin Zhang, Manojkumar Krishnan, and Evan 
Gawlik.  We also thank all TAO users for their comments, bug reports, and 
encouragement.

The development of TAO is supported by the Office of Advanced Scientific 
Computing Research, Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, under 
Contract DE-AC02-06CH11357.  We also thank the Argonne Laboratory Computing 
Resource Center and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center 
for allowing us to test and run TAO applications on their machines.
